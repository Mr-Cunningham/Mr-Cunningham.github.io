<h1> Randy Cunningham </h1>

<p class="intro"> I'm a graduate of Drexel University. I enjoy listening to music at incredibly high volumes. But only becasue I'm practicing mixing. I'm also interested in learning more about web design and UX/UI.</p>

		Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
